
STARSHIP COMMAND

A clone of the original Acornsoft game, originally designed by Peter Irvin
(Big thanks for many happy hours of childhood)

This version by Nicholas Hollands, as an exercise in learning Unity.

Ship graphics shamelessly lifted from the original binaries, engine drone noise sampled from BeebEm.
'Acorn-Mode-1' font by p1.mark from fontstruct used under CC-by-SA 3.0 licence.
All other assets made by me.  
Big thanks to bfxr.net and all the antecedents of that for the sound FX generator

Notes
~~~~~

Large enemy ships start appearing from level 2 onwards.  They can fire when cloaked.  And they can cloak.
Discretion is often the better part of valour, but moving uses more energy than you think.
Star-Fleet authorities are WAY more forgiving in this version over the original.
A dead captain has no chance of starting a new level, and death can come swiftly.  Remember your escape pods.

There are cheats.
